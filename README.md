# Vehicle Search

Uses the <a href="https://rapidapi.com/carapi/api/car-api2">Car API</a> to query data of all major car company's models between 1990 to present.  Apollo Client and React are used for the front end without a database.

# Goal

Once the 3-part menu is working properly (Year, Make, & Model), this will interact with the Unsplash API to render a photo of the selected vehicle.  I will design the website with Figma and integrate this menu into it.
